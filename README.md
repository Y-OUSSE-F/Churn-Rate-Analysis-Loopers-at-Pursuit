# Churn Rate Analysis Loopers at Pursuit

What are the chances of loopers who have previously exited a 1 year coding fellowship, eventually reaching completion? This question, amongst others is one that I answer in my analysis, but a core piece of context for understanding these documents is knowing, what exactly a 'looper' is.

*A looper is what we define at Pursuit as someone who exits the 1 year long fellowship program at any point in time, with intention to return.*

For this reason they are not marked as withdrawn upon separation, although some fellows do eventually fully withdraw. Some of these fellows return to complete on their second, sometimes even third tries, others have yet to even re-enroll. This file is an altered public version of a deck presented internally at Pursuit, that was presented in front of executive management.

## **Abstract**
This analysis aims to pinpoint the stage at which individuals in the Pursuit fellowship program are most susceptible to exiting, referred to as “looping out.” We are trying to use historical data to make actionable insights on reducing this churn rate. The primary objectives include determining the overall looper churn rate, categorizing characteristics defining the ‘looper profile,’ and understanding the causative factors leading to fellows exiting the program. The desired outcome is to identify a separation timing marked as ‘Completed,’ indicating successful program completion, and thereby, maximizing the number of fellows who successfully finish the fellowship. This analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing the fellowship program, enhancing participant retention, considering possible altering to admissions processes, and identifying key factors that contribute to fellow success.
