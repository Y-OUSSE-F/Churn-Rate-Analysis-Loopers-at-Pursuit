# Churn Rate Analysis Loopers at Pursuit
What are the chances of different individuals who have previously exited a 1 year coding fellowship, eventually reaching completion? This file is an altered public version of a deck presented internally at my current workplace, that was presented in front of executive management.

## **Abstract**
This analysis aims to pinpoint the stage at which individuals in the Pursuit fellowship program are most susceptible to exiting, referred to as “looping out.” We are trying to use historical data to make actionable insights on reducing this churn rate. The primary objectives include determining the overall looper churn rate, categorizing characteristics defining the ‘looper profile,’ and understanding the causative factors leading to fellows exiting the program. The desired outcome is to identify a separation timing marked as ‘Completed,’ indicating successful program completion, and thereby, maximizing the number of fellows who successfully finish the fellowship. This analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing the fellowship program, enhancing participant retention, considering possible altering to admissions processes, and identifying key factors that contribute to fellow success.
