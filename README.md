# Pursuit Fellowship Churn Rate Analysis

Welcome to the Pursuit Fellowship Churn Rate Analysis project! This repository contains an altered public version of a deck presented internally at Pursuit, which was then presented in front of executive management. 

## Introduction

This analysis focuses on understanding the phenomenon of "looping out" within the Pursuit fellowship program. Looping out refers to the act of exiting the 1-year long fellowship program with the intention to return at a later date. While some individuals return to complete the program on their second or third attempt, others may choose not to re-enroll.

## What is a "Looper"?

At Pursuit, a "looper" is defined as someone who exits the fellowship program at any point in time with the intention to return. This distinction is important as loopers are not marked as withdrawn upon separation. 

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are:

- Determine the overall looper churn rate
- Categorize characteristics defining the "looper profile"
- Understand the causative factors leading to fellows exiting the program
- Identify a separation timing marked as "Completed," indicating successful program completion
- Maximize the number of fellows who successfully finish the fellowship

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing the fellowship program, enhancing participant retention, considering possible alterations to admissions processes, and identifying key factors that contribute to fellow success.
